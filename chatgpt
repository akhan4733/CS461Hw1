implement a depth first search in java for a graph. The graphs have cities that contain a name of type string to identify. 
They also have a long and latitude of type double however these are not going to be used in the depth first search. 
Make the depth first search iterative and not recursive. Return a list of the cities for the path. 
This path finding function should take in two cities, the start and the end. it should return a path to the end city


rewrite this to instead use a breadth first search


rewrite this to instead use id-dfs


rewrite this to use a best first search instead with the heuristic being the distance calcualted from the long and lat to the end city


rewrite this to use A-star algorithm instead with the heuristic being the distance calcualted from the long and lat to the end city
